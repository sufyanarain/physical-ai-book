# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** — your comprehensive guide to bridging the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to AI systems that operate in the real world, understanding and interacting with physical environments. Unlike traditional AI confined to digital spaces, Physical AI:

- Comprehends physical laws (gravity, friction, momentum)
- Processes sensory data (vision, touch, sound)
- Controls actuators to perform physical tasks
- Learns from real-world interactions

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

1. **Share Our Form**: Can navigate spaces designed for humans
2. **Leverage Human Data**: Train on abundant human movement data
3. **Natural Interaction**: Communicate through familiar gestures and expressions
4. **Versatile Applications**: From healthcare to manufacturing

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the middleware that connects robot components, enabling communication between sensors, actuators, and AI systems.

**Topics:**
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- URDF for robot description
- Python integration with rclpy

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Master physics simulation and environment building for testing robots in virtual worlds before real deployment.

**Topics:**
- Gazebo simulation fundamentals
- Physics engines and sensor simulation
- Unity for high-fidelity rendering
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Explore NVIDIA's cutting-edge platform for AI-powered robotics, including perception, navigation, and manipulation.

**Topics:**
- Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception
- VSLAM and navigation with Nav2
- Synthetic data generation

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate large language models with robotics for natural language control and cognitive planning.

**Topics:**
- Voice-to-action with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based task planning
- Multimodal robot control
- **Capstone Project**: Autonomous humanoid robot

## Learning Outcomes
