# Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac

**NVIDIA Isaac** is the AI robot platform accelerating robotics development with GPU-powered perception, simulation, and manipulation. This platform is designed to streamline the development process of robotics applications by providing a comprehensive set of tools and libraries.

## Isaac Platform Components

### 1. Isaac Sim
Isaac Sim is a photorealistic robot simulation built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It provides a realistic environment for testing and training robots, reducing the need for physical prototypes and accelerating the development process. Key features of Isaac Sim include:

- **Ray tracing**: Physically accurate lighting that simulates the way light interacts with objects in the real world. This is similar to how graphics rendering works in video games, but with a focus on realistic lighting.
- **Physics**: PhysX 5.0 engine, which simulates the physical behavior of objects in the environment. This engine is responsible for simulating collisions, friction, and other physical interactions between objects.
- **Synthetic data**: Perfect ground truth for AI training, which eliminates the need for manual data labeling. Synthetic data is generated by the simulation and can be used to train machine learning models.

### 2. Isaac ROS
Isaac ROS is a set of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages that provide advanced perception capabilities for robots. ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open-source software framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building robot applications. Key features of Isaac ROS include:

- **VSLAM**: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, which enables robots to navigate and map their environment in real-time. VSLAM uses computer vision algorithms to track the robot's movement and build a map of the environment.
- **Object detection**: Real-time AI inference, which enables robots to detect and recognize objects in their environment. Object detection uses machine learning algorithms to identify objects and classify them into different categories.
- **Navigation**: Nav2 integration, which provides a navigation system for robots to move around their environment. Nav2 is a navigation framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building navigation systems.

### 3. Isaac SDK
Isaac SDK is a set of libraries for robotics applications that provide advanced manipulation, perception, and navigation capabilities. Key features of Isaac SDK include:

- **Manipulation**: Grasp planning, motion control, and other manipulation capabilities that enable robots to interact with their environment. Manipulation involves the use of robotic arms or grippers to manipulate objects.
- **Perception**: 3D reconstruction, segmentation, and other perception capabilities that enable robots to understand their environment. Perception involves the use of sensors such as cameras, lidar, or radar to perceive the environment.
- **Navigation**: Path planning, obstacle avoidance, and other navigation capabilities that enable robots to move around their environment. Navigation involves the use of algorithms to plan a path and avoid obstacles.

- **VRAM**: 8GB minimum, 24GB recommended, which provides the necessary memory for simulation and rendering.
- **RAM**: 32GB minimum, which provides the necessary memory for the operating system and other applications.
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or Windows 10/11, which provides a compatible operating system for the Isaac platform.

### Installation

```bash
# Download from NVIDIA Omniverse
# https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/apps/isaac-sim/

# Or use Docker
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2023.1.1

# Run Isaac Sim
./isaac-sim.sh
```

## Creating a Robot in Isaac Sim

### Import URDF

```python
import omni
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage

# Load robot URDF
robot_path = "/path/to/robot.urdf"
add_reference_to_stage(usd_path=robot_path, prim_path="/World/Robot")
```

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a file format used to describe the structure and properties of a robot. The `add_reference_to_stage` function is used to load the URDF file into the Isaac Sim environment.

### Add Sensors

```python
from omni.isaac.sensor import Camera

# Create camera
camera = Camera(
    prim_path="/World/Robot/Camera",
    frequency=30,
    resolution=(1920, 1080)
)
```

Sensors such as cameras, lidar, or radar are used to perceive the environment and provide data for perception and navigation algorithms. The `Camera` class is used to create a camera sensor in the Isaac Sim environment.

## Isaac ROS for Real Robots

# Create camera
camera = rep.create.camera(position=(5, 5, 5))

# Randomize lighting
with rep.trigger.on_frame():
    rep.randomizer.light_intensity(
        lights=rep.get.prims(semantics="light"),
        min_value=500,
        max_value=2000

    robot_articulation,
    physics_dt
)

# Generate collision-free trajectory
trajectory = policy.compute_joint_targets(target_pose)
